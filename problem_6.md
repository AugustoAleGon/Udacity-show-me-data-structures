## Union and intersection ##

### Union ###
In the union method, we are storing all the unique values on a set, so we are iterate through all the values of a linked list and we need to compare both linked lists. So in terms of time complexity is O(n) and for space complexity is the total sum of both length of the linked list, that would be O(n) as well.


### Intersection ###
In the intersection method, we are applying the same approach as Union. We are storing the values in a set and then based on those values we are gonna know exactly is the elements are in the second linked list. If the elements are duplicated then we found the intersection. In terms of time complexity is O(n) and also the space is O(n).
