## Union and intersection ##

For union and intersection, we have a helper methods that iterates through all the linked list and create a set which as we know the set won't have duplicate values which is perfect for what we want to achieve.

After we convert our linked list into a set we can use the union method and the intersection method of set. With these result then we create a new Linked List and append each value of the set.

For both union and intersection we have a complexity of O(n) in time and complexity.
