## Find Files ##

For finding files in a root directory, we are using a recursive method, because we need to explore each available path of the root.
For time complexity, because we are iterating over all the path is gonna take us O(n) and for space because we are saving each path in order to get the absolute path we are having O(n) in terms of space as well.
